The Ford Foundation awards predoctoral, dissertation and postdoctoral fellowships to a broad range of fields.

I applied for the 1 year dissertation fellowship both in the fall of 2014 and 2015. This first year I made it to Honorable Mention and was awarded the fellowship. 

I am uploading both the Honorable Mention version and the year that I was awarded the fellowship. You will see they are very similar though I feel that the second one clicked well.

Let me know if you have any questions about the award itself and being a Ford Fellow (which is awesome :))
